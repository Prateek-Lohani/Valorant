        <article class="game-info-section">
            <p class="p-left">Valorant is a team-based first-person tactical hero shooter set in the near future.<br>
                Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters based on several countries and <br>
               cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the <br>
               attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique <br>
                abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires <br>
               charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with <br>
                a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges. Other weapons and ability <br>
               charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the <br>
               outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives <br>
                completed. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms <br>
               and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper <br>
                rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting <br>
                pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately. <br>
                It currently offers 23 agents to choose from. The player will get 5 unlocked agents <br>
                when they create their account, and will have to unlock the rest of the agents by <br>
                collecting an in-game currency called Kingdom Credits. Kingdom Credits can be <br>
               acquired by playing games or completing daily and weekly tasks, and can be spent <br>
               on unlock new agents or cosmetic items. However, within the first 28 days of release, <br>
                new Agents can only be unlocked with Valorant Points (VP), Agent Recruitment Events, <br>
                or by having a linked and active Xbox Game Pass subscription. <br>
               VP is an in-game currency that can only obtained by purchasing it with real money, <br>
                and it can be spent on cosmetic items or new agents. <br></p>
                <p class="p-right">Valorant was developed and published by Riot Games, <br>
                    the studio behind League of Legends. <br>
                    Development started in 2014, <br> 
                    within their research and development division. <br>
                    Game director Joe Ziegler is credited with the initial idea <br>
                    of Valorant while formulating potential games with other Riot developers. <br>
                    David Nottingham is the creative director for Valorant. <br>
                    Trevor Romleski, former League of Legends's designer and Salvatore Garozzo, <br>
                    former professional player and map designer for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive are its game designers. <br>
                    Moby Francke, former Valve developer,  <br>
                    who has been art and character designer for Half-Life 2 and Team Fortress 2, is the art director. <br>
                    <br><br>
                    Valorant was developed with two main focuses: making tactical shooters and e-sports more  <br>
                    accessible to new players,and creating a game that would attract a large competitive scene, <br>
                    while solving many of the points of criticism  voiced by professional players from games in the genre. <br>
                    Games aimed at large, active communities and player bases, typically free-to-play games like Fortnite or Riot's own League of Legends, <br>
                    tend to put an emphasis on a wider array of system performance improvements and game stability rather than  <br>
                    newer technologies or graphics as a way of making sure they're as accessible as possible.  <br>
                    In interviews leading up to the game's launch, game director Joe Ziegler and producer Anna Donlon said that Valorant <br>
                    was made for people playing their first tactical shooter just as much as it was for professional players, <br>
                    and that accessibility of the game was a large priority.</p>
